### [Do Founder-Led Stocks Outperform?](https://anishagrawal.substack.com/p/founder-stock-index)


### Abstract
Founder-led companies are widely believed to benefit from the passion and vision of their founders—a trait often credited with driving early-stage success. This study explores whether such intrinsic advantages translate into superior performance in the public markets. The experiment constructs a custom index of NYSE-listed companies led by their founding CEOs, each with a market cap exceeding $1B.  

The index is benchmarked against the S&P 500 using market-cap weighting, and special care is taken to adjust for outsized influences such as NVIDIA. Even after these adjustments, the results reveal a striking performance gap: over a ten-year period, the founder-led index delivers an annualized return of 59.52%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s 11.04%. These findings underscore the potential long-term benefits of founder leadership and prompt further inquiry into the broader impact of founder influence on company success.
